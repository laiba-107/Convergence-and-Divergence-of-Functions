# Convergence-and-Divergence-of-Functions
This repository contains Python code that explores the concepts of convergence and divergence of functions. The scripts include implementations and visualizations to demonstrate how various functions behave as they approach limits or infinity. The code is designed to help understand these mathematical concepts through practical examples and can be a valuable resource for students and enthusiasts in mathematics and computational sciences.
Features:
Implementation of sequences and series to test for convergence or divergence
Visualization of function behavior using matplotlib
Examples of common convergent and divergent functions
Comprehensive comments and documentation for easy understanding
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Matplotlib
Numpy
