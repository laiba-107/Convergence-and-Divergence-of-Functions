# Convergence-and-Divergence-of-Functions
This repository contains Python code that explores the concepts of convergence and divergence of functions. The scripts include implementations and visualizations to demonstrate how various functions behave as they approach limits or infinity. Designed to help understand these mathematical concepts through practical examples, the code can be a valuable resource for students and enthusiasts in mathematics and computational sciences. Features include the implementation of sequences and series to test for convergence or divergence, visualization of function behavior using Matplotlib, and examples of common convergent and divergent functions, with comprehensive comments and documentation for easy understanding. The project requires Python 3.x, Matplotlib, and Numpy.
